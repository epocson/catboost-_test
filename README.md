# Enhanced Population Forecasting with CatBoost

An advanced population forecasting system that uses the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to predict future population trends with higher accuracy and reliability.

## Features

- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Uses CatBoost gradient boosting for accurate population prediction
- **Comprehensive Feature Engineering**: Creates sophisticated features from demographic data
- **Confidence Intervals**: Provides statistical confidence bounds on all forecasts
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Creates high-quality plots with historical and forecast data
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive population statistics and growth metrics
- **Model Performance Analysis**: Includes detailed metrics and feature importance rankings

```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- CatBoost
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/population-forecasting-catboost.git
cd population-forecasting-catboost

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the enhanced forecasting model:

```bash
python run_improved_forecast.py
```

This will:
1. Load historical population data from 2015-2024
2. Train a CatBoost model (or load a pre-trained one if available)
3. Generate forecasts for 2025-2030 with confidence intervals
4. Create visualizations and detailed reports
5. Save results to the 'forecasts' directory

## Sample Output

### Population Forecast Summary
```
Current Population (2024): 146,039,963
Forecasted Population (2030): 146,069,455
Total Change: 29,492 (0.02%)
Average Annual Growth Rate: 0.003%
```

### CatBoost Improvements

The enhanced CatBoost implementation significantly improves forecast accuracy by:

1. Creating advanced features (lags, ratios, moving averages)
2. Capturing non-linear relationships in demographic data
3. Proper time series validation
4. Optimized hyperparameters
5. Feature importance analysis
